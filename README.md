## 🗺️ Challenge Structure

The challenge is structured into **four phases**, progressing from fundamentals to advanced AI analytics:  

### **PHASE 1: Foundation (Days 1–4)**  
Covers Databricks setup, basic concepts, Spark fundamentals, and data transformations. Learners gain hands-on experience with notebooks, RDDs, and DataFrames.  

### **PHASE 2: Data Engineering (Days 5–8)**  
Focuses on **Delta Lake, Medallion Architecture**, and job automation. Students learn to design efficient pipelines, implement versioning, and manage governance.  

### **PHASE 3: Advanced Analytics (Days 9–11)**  
Teaches **SQL analytics, performance tuning, and statistical preparation**. Learners work on real datasets to create interactive queries and optimized analytics.  

### **PHASE 4: AI & ML (Days 12–14)**  
Introduces **MLflow, model comparison, and generative AI techniques**. Learners track experiments, evaluate models, and build AI-driven solutions to extract insights.  

By the end of the challenge, learners can confidently handle **end-to-end Databricks workflows**, from raw data ingestion to AI-powered analytics.
